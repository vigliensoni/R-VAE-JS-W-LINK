# R-VAE-JS
## RELS: Rhythmic explorations of latent spaces

This web-based device enables the easy exploration of a latent space learned from a dataset of rhythms using a VAE.

Based on [Nao Tokui's RhythmVAE](https://github.com/naotokui/RhythmVAE_M4L)

Audio playback working on Firefox and Chrome. MIDI output only working on Chrome.

Play with latest version of R-VAE on the browser: https://vigliensoni.github.io/R-VAE-JS-dev/


### Installation:

To install packages:
``` bash
npm install
```

To create distribution

``` bash
npm run build
```

After webpack is executed all the required components will be packaged and ready to be used in the `dist` folder.

The demo running on Github is served from the `docs` folder, and so the contents from `dist` have to be copied over.

### Ableton Link bridge

The Link bridge is bundled with this project so the browser sequencer can join a wider Ableton Link session.

1. Build (or rebuild) the client bundle: `npm run build`
2. Launch the bridge server: `npm start`
3. Open `http://localhost:808` in a browser tab – the static assets in `dist/` are served automatically.
4. Join the Ableton Link session from other peers; the tempo dial in the UI now follows (and publishes to) the shared Link tempo.
